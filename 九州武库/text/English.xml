    <entitydescription.tsm_rp>Chris Evans\nA Moment More Brilliant Than Tears</entitydescription.tsm_rp>
    <tsm_chris_c1>In the crowd you see someone who looks familiar, and to verify your suspicions you run up and call out to him.
      “Haven't we met somewhere before?”
       He just turned around, and your eyes immediately caught a hideous, deep scar on his face - sure enough, unsurprisingly, he was none other than the former leader of Beowulf Squadron, who was once wanted by the Alliance - Chris Evans.</tsm_chris_c1>
    <tsm_chris_p1>Even though his expression was as cold as ice, there was still a trace of imperceptible fluctuation that swept through his eyes in that moment.</tsm_chris_p1>
    <tsm_chris_c2>His hand slowly reached for his waist, his movements seemingly calm but full of oppression, as if the air would be suffocated by ignition in the next second. Your gazes met at this moment, as sharp as blades meeting, and the atmosphere suddenly froze, dropping to freezing point.
      “Hey! Take it easy, I think we're on the same page” You raise your hands, palms facing outwards, and swing them slowly, trying to break the tension in front of you with a calm tone. You don't move very much, fearing that the slightest mistake could lead to an irreversible confrontation.
      Chris stares at you, his hand stopping at his waist as if weighing the truth of your words. After a moment, he finally relaxes a bit, but still hasn't completely removed his defenses.</tsm_chris_c2>
    <tsm_chris_p2>“Follow me.”
      You whisper, nodding to him, and then slowly turn around, moving carefully for fear of arousing his suspicions.</tsm_chris_p2>
    <tsm_chris_c3>You lead him through several dimly lit passages until you come to a remote corner - undisturbed and free of surveillance eyes.
      “It's safe here, so we can talk.” You settle against the wall, your eyes looking straight at him, your tone calm but not careless . “Abuse of force, violent lynching, murder, insubordination ...... each of these charges is written under your name.” Your voice is low, yet sharp as a blade, each word seems to pierce the air and drive right into his heart, “Now, the people of Europa talk about you like you're the messenger of death. Seeing you, it's as if life will be taken from them in the next second.”
      “Join me!” Your tone is firm with a sincerity that can't be ignored, and your gaze is like a razor's edge as you look straight at Chris, “With me, you're absolutely safe. The Coalition's most wanted, those hounds hunting you, none of them can threaten you. I have the power to protect you from being consumed by their schemes and shackles.” You take a slight step forward, lowering your voice but making each word as clear as thunder, “And not just protection - I can give you the chance to liquidate those who are guilty. Those elements that started the chaos and provoked the riots should not escape the judgment they deserve!”
      When Chris heard the words “liquidate those who are guilty”, a light flashed in his originally cold eyes, as if it had ignited some long-buried emotions deep inside him. He exhaled a mouthful of smoke, narrowed his eyes, and slowly spoke, “I don't care about the Coalition's wanted, they've been trying to catch me for more than a day or two.” He paused, with a few hints of testing and disdain in his tone, “On the contrary, it's the trial you mentioned that does make me a bit interested. But empty words are no proof, come up with something tangible, how do you prove that you have the strength that can make me join.
      “On Europa, only the truly powerful are qualified to talk about judgment and order. What about you? What are you entitled to?”</tsm_chris_c3>
    <tsm_chris_p3>Here's my proof. (pulls out Beowulf Medal of Honor)</tsm_chris_p3>

    <tsm_chris_c_e2>Looks like you'll have to have more lighters on board. Come on, Captain, let's get ready to liquidate the guilty!</tsm_chris_c_e2>
