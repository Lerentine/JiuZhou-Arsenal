  <entitydescription.tsm_rp>Chris Evans
  A moment brighter than tears</entitydescription.tsm_rp>
  <tsm_chris_c1>In the crowd, you spot someone very familiar. To confirm your guess, you run up and call out to him.
  "Have we met somewhere before?"
  As he turns around, your eyes immediately catch a grotesque and deep scar on his face—just as you suspected, he is indeed the former captain of the Beowulf Squad who was once wanted by the Coalition—Chris Evans.</tsm_chris_c1>
  <tsm_chris_p1>Despite his icy demeanor, there is still an imperceptible flicker in his eyes for a moment.</tsm_chris_p1>
  <tsm_chris_c2>His hand slowly reaches for his waist, as if the air would be ignited in the next second, suffocating. Your gazes intersect at this moment, the atmosphere suddenly solidifies, dropping to freezing point.
  "Hey! Don't be nervous," you raise your hands, palms out, slowly waving them, trying to break the tense atmosphere with a calm tone. Your movements are not large, for fear that any misstep would trigger an irreparable conflict.
  Chris stares at you, his hand resting on his waist, seemingly weighing the truth of your words. After a moment, he finally relaxes a bit, but still does not let his guard down completely.</tsm_chris_c2>
  <tsm_chris_p2>"Follow me," you whisper, nodding at him, then turn and walk towards a small passage.</tsm_chris_p2>
  <tsm_chris_c3>You lead him through several dim corridors until you reach a secluded corner—undisturbed by others and free from surveillance.
  "It's safe here. We can talk properly," you lean against the wall. "Abuse of power, violent private punishment, murder, disobedience of orders... all these charges are written under your name." Your voice is deep, each word piercing through the air and straight into his heart. "Now, when people on Europa talk about you, they talk about you as if you were the messenger of death. Seeing you, it seems that life will be taken away from them in the next second."
  Chris listens silently, lowering his head, taking out a crumpled cigarette from his pocket, slowly putting it to his lips, and lighting it with a lighter. The fire flickers in the dim corner, casting his face in an even darker shade. The deep scar looks particularly grotesque in the interplay of light and shadow, as if it were an indelible mark. He takes a deep drag, exhales slowly through his nostrils, enveloping himself in a cloud of smoke, carrying a heavy and cold sense of oppression. He raises his head, his gaze piercing through the smoke, looking straight at you, his eyes filled with a complex emotion, a mix of mockery and a silent warning.
  "Join me!" Your tone is firm. "Here, you will definitely be safe. The Coalition's wanted order, those hounds chasing you, cannot threaten you. Here, you can be free from being swallowed by their conspiracies and shackles." You take a small step forward, lowering your voice. "And it's not just protection—I can give you the chance to settle accounts with those evil people. Those who cause chaos and incite riots should not escape their deserved judgment!"
  When Chris hears the words "settle accounts with those evil people," a glimmer of light flashes in his originally indifferent eyes, as if igniting some long-buried emotion deep within him. He exhales a cloud of smoke, squints his eyes, and slowly speaks: "I don't care about the Coalition's wanted order. They've wanted to catch me for a long time." He pauses, his tone tinged with a hint of probing and disdain: "It's your mention of judgment that interests me a bit. But words are empty. Show something concrete. How do you prove that you have the strength to make me join?"
  "In this world, only those who are truly powerful have the right to talk about judgment and order. And you? What makes you qualified?"</tsm_chris_c3>
  <tsm_chris_p3>This is my proof (takes out the Beowulf Medal)</tsm_chris_p3>
  <tsm_chris_c_e1>How could you have it?</tsm_chris_c_e1>
  <tsm_chris_p_e>I never care about the process, only the result</tsm_chris_p_e>
  <tsm_chris_c_e2>Looks like you'll need to stock up on more lighters on your ship. Come on, Captain, let's start clearing out those guilty ones!</tsm_chris_c_e2>

However, due to the demanding materials, it has not been adopted. Some officers are willing to pay out of pocket to get such an exquisite weapon.</entitydescription.tsm_lm_hk433>
  <entityname.tsm_lm_97>Coalition Type 97 Rapid Riot Rifle</entityname.tsm_lm_97>
  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_97>A newly modified bullpup rifle in response to the requests of some Coalition units.

  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_drh>An assault rifle using ‖color:0,200,0,255‖6.8mm‖color:end‖ military ammunition. It has a high rate of fire and considerable power, but the significant recoil from the 6.8mm ammunition requires long-term training to master.</entitydescription.tsm_lm_drh>

  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_cz805a1>A standard weapon that was not adopted by the Coalition, but it is by no means inferior. The more aesthetically pleasing layout, folding stock, and use of engineering plastics make the weight more comfortable. It uses the Coalition-issued ‖color:0,200,0,255‖5.56mm‖color:end‖ magazine.</entitydescription.tsm_lm_cz805a1>

  <entityname.tsm_lm_dp12>DP-12 Pump-Action Suppression Shotgun</entityname.tsm_lm_dp12>
  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_dp12>A terrifying double-barreled beast. When enemies see it for the first time, they are already blown against the wall by the double shots. It can provide an absolute suppressive advantage for the team's first move, creating enough combat space for subsequent teammates. The enemies in the way have already been blown away. It is the favorite of the team's point man and breacher.</entitydescription.tsm_lm_dp12>
  <entityname.tsm_lm_ks23>KS-23 Pump-Action Suppression Shotgun</entityname.tsm_lm_ks23>
  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_ks23>Uses the ‖color:0,200,0,255‖No. 4 shot‖color:end‖, which has been banned by the Europa Convention. In fact, the gun itself is also banned. It has a terrifying 23mm caliber, but as long as you manage to saw off the barrel of a howitzer and mix the ammunition of three No. 12 shotshells, you can get it. Remember, no war has ever changed because of a humanitarian treaty.</entitydescription.tsm_lm_ks23>
  <entityname.tsm_lm_spas12>Franchi SPAS-12 Shotgun</entityname.tsm_lm_spas12>
  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_spas12>An old multi-functional shotgun that can be both pump-action and semi-automatic, so its rate of fire is generally higher than that of ordinary shotguns. Many problems can't be solved without a few shots from it.</entitydescription.tsm_lm_spas12>
  <entityname.tsm_lm_ash12>Coalition ASH-12 Anti-Terrorism Assault Rifle</entityname.tsm_lm_ash12>
  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_ash12>The Coalition Beowulf squad has repeatedly reported that separatists can still counterattack after being shot multiple times in conventional calibers until they bleed to death. Although this situation has not been truly verified, the Coalition still agreed to equip the Beowulf squad with some large-caliber anti-terror rifles using the Coalition ‖color:0,200,0,255‖12.7*55‖color:end‖ rifle magazine. Of course, the significant recoil from full-auto fire can only be handled by real men.</entitydescription.tsm_lm_ash12>

  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_m249>Though its lethality is somewhat lacking, it uses a 200-round belt feed that offers reliability and strong firepower, making it the most durable and sustained-fire weapon in an infantry squad. It can be mounted with a bipod for added stability. Uses ‖color:0,200,0,255‖Coalition LMG magazine (5.56*45)‖color:end‖.</entitydescription.tsm_lm_m249>

  <entitydescription.tsm_lm_minigun>A handheld Gatling gun, even using the same ammunition as assault rifles can knock inexperienced shooters backward.

  <entityname.tsm_ksg>Coalition KSG Bullpup Pump-Action Shotgun</entityname.tsm_ksg>
  <entitydescription.tsm_ksg>Compact yet capable of holding 9 rounds, this is a huge advantage in the cramped cabins of Europa.

<missionmessage0.tsm_combat_nz>The bullet pierced through the brain. In a daze, he seemed to stand on a stage, seeing the audience in complete darkness, yet he could clearly hear two people speaking.
“Who is playing on this stage?” one voice questioned.
Another voice replied, “The person on stage seems clumsy yet moves with ease. If he is not playing the fool, then he must be the king.”
As soon as the words were spoken, applause erupted from the audience, and a joyful symphony began to play.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of Solomon.</missionmessage0.tsm_combat_nz>
